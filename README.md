Nameznik
Adds some points from railway - fouling points, end points of train route, border points of railway companies - in Czech and Slovak design and fouling point in Austrian design. Technical names of nodes are in Czech language.

Repaintable and rotatable with my mod Repainter.
Not contain crafting recipes.

Nodeboxes of translated points are on the registered place, not viewable place!

Best with AdvTrains and other advtrains-based mods.

KNOWED ISSUES:
1st) Mod creator has a procrastination for update and upgrade of
Noderoads and Nodehouses for a long time (but works on update).
2nd) Nodeboxes are not so much real as mod creator needs.
